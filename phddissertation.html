<h4> <b>Abstract</b> </h4>

<!-- Scaling graph analytics is challenging. -->
<!-- 
My dissertation research focused on accelerating parallel graph processing using approximate computing. I designed techniques for improving the efficiency of graph analytics on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) by trading-off computational accuracy.
When the graph sizes are huge (e.g., billion-scale networks), or the underlying processing is expensive, it is not always feasible to compute the exact solution in time. A practical question to ask in such scenarios is: "given an infrastructure, how to make the best use of resources to obtain an acceptable, inexact solution in a reasonable time?"
I sought to answer this question by bringing parallelism and approximate computing into a convergent trajectory to make heavy-weight graph computation practical and scalable.

<p style="font-size:16px;">
A multitude of real-world problems is modeled as graphs where nodes represent entities
of interest, and edges capture the relationships among them. In recent years, Graphics
Processing Units (GPUs) have gained popularity as accelerators for compute-intensive
data-parallel applications due to the massive data-parallelism they offer and their high
memory bandwidth. Graph algorithms are inherently irregular, while GPUs are best
suited for structured data-parallel computation. Scaling graph algorithms is challenging
today due to the rapid growth of unstructured and semi-structured data. The prior art has
targeted parallelizing popular graph algorithms on various kinds of architectures such
as multi-core CPUs, many-core GPU, and distributed and heterogeneous systems. The
primary technical challenge posed by graphs is due to inherent irregularity in the data access, control-flow, and communication patterns. The recent past has witnessed the
emergence of very effective techniques to represent graphs compactly, tame irregular
computations, and efficiently map those to the underlying hardware. However, when
the graph sizes are huge (e.g., billion-scale networks), or the underlying processing is
expensive, it is not practically viable to compute the exact solution in time.

The focus of this thesis is on making graph processing more scalable. We look
to achieve this by enhancing the performance of parallel graph algorithms on GPU by
trading off computational accuracy, using approximate computing. We propose several
i) algorithm- and architecture-independent, ii) algorithm-independent but architecture-specific, and iii) algorithm-specific but architecture-independent techniques for enhancing parallel graph processing efficiency using approximate computing. We present
Graprox, a set of four algorithm- and architecture-independent approximate computing
techniques that improve the performance of parallel graph analytics by exploiting the
general structure of the graph kernel and the flow of information in graph algorithms.

Graph analytics on GPU suffers from low coalesced accesses, high memory latency,
and high workload imbalance. To alleviate these issues, we present Graffix, a framework with three novel graph transformation techniques that alter the graph structure to
enable faster processing in exchange for small inaccuracies in the final results. Graffixâ€™s
method for improving memory coalescing creates a graph isomorph that brings relevant
nodes nearby in memory and adds a controlled replica of nodes. The second technique
reduces memory latency by facilitating the processing of subgraphs inside shared memory by adding edges among specific nodes and processing well-connected subgraphs
iteratively inside shared-memory. The third normalizes degrees across nodes assigned
to a warp to reduce thread divergence.

Third, we focus on algorithm-specific but architecture-independent approximate
computing techniques for improved parallel execution. Specifically, we propose
ParTBC, an ensemble of techniques targeted at speeding up the computation of topk betweenness centrality vertices on GPU. The proposals restrict the computation of
shortest paths from only a fraction of the vertices in parallel betweenness centrality
computation, using online stopping criteria to terminate the computation faster.

All the proposals provide <i>tunable knobs</i> to change the degree of approximation injected and control the performance-accuracy trade-off in graph applications. Further,
the approximate computing techniques complement (and do not compete with) the existing optimization techniques, and could be applied on top of these optimizations to
enhance the execution performance further.

We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques on graphs of varying characteristics and sizes and popular graph algorithms through extensive experimental evaluation. Overall, we show that approximate computation of graph algorithms is a robust
way of dealing with irregularities. Approximate computing combined with parallelization promises to make heavy-weight graph computation practical, as well as, scalable.
